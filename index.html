            Timing is everything, or so they say. I think of a close friend of mine who decided that 
            his time was now. Despite being at the start of the 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis">biggest period of uncertainty we had
            known for years</a>, he had become convinced that if he didn’t act now, he would sink ever
            deeper into the quicksand of comfortability otherwise known as a steady career.
        </p>

            How do you know you will find work? You’ve already got a decent job, why
            start again? And,  It seems too risky given the recession and the effect it has
            already had on the economy, were just a few of the questions he faced from
            friends and loved ones as he became ever more firm in his conviction. His
            answers were always the same i.e. because i’m not happy, because there’s only
            so much time left, because if i want to feel fulfilled, if i want it to change i’ve
            got no choice.

            Looking back, I think it's clear to see that there was a man at the end of his tether.
            Stuck in a manual role that although was well paid, gave him little in the
            way of satisfaction. He would tell me that he wanted more. More than he could
            ever get in his current role. He wanted satisfaction, he wanted to go to work
            excited about the challenges of the day ahead. That if it meant a drop in earnings
            while he trained for a new role, he was convinced that in the long run, he would
            look back at this decision as the most important and positive one he's made.
        </p>

            That friend went by the name of Tony and I’ve known him all my life.
            Sometimes I listened to his advice, sometimes I didn't, but every time I thought
            he was wrong, I've lived to regret not following him. He has matured over the
            years, starting out as an unrealistic risk taker, an all night raver, a drunken
            dancer, into what i now feel is a much more grounded, reasonable and
            trustworthy companion. It took time, mistakes (more than you can imagine) and 
            many regrets to get him to this point, but if anything, these mistakes and 
            struggles were what made him who he is.
        </p>
        <p>
            That friend is my inner voice and this time I'm following him. Standing at the 
            start of a journey that hopefully, with enough hardwork and dedication, will lead 
            to us to not just a more fulfilling career, but a more fulfilling life. I know 
            nothing is certain, it could end up a mistake, but if there's even the slightest 
            chance that it could work out, I'm in.
        </p>
